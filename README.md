## Next Steps:
<p> We plan on implementing more into the profile.  We want to be able to add a Hangover tip that has full CRUD functionality. So each user can view other user's tip and be able to create their own</p>
<p> We also wanted to impliment a bar component where users can go to a different screen and be able to have all the ingredients shown.  From their they would be able to click and ingredient and measurement and be able to put together their own drink.</p>
<p>We also want to impliment a BAC calculator that might live on the review page.  This feature would be able to calculate your BAC based on the measurements and the strength of ingredients you chose.</p>
